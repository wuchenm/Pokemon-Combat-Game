A simple Pokemon Combat game made in Python 

# Important Notes:
To fully run the program, it requires...
- Install pygame (pip3 install pygame)
- Install requests (pip3 install requests)
- Should also install Certificates.command, this is done directly on your computer, locate the python install folder and then run certificates.command, should be a file named "Install Certificated.command" then double click it (you should see messages in the terminal indicating the progress of installation)
- Make sure to install all the content from github all mp3 files so the game can run (Intro, PokemonCombatMusic and PokemonEndMusic mp3 files)

# How to run the program
Press the run button and play the game as normal. After running the program a new window should be opened with the game. Initially there are three pokemons which the user can pick and also some music in the background.

# "Limitation" IMPORTANT:
Sometimes the click is bugged, so there will be games in which you will only have to click once and it will play normally. However, there will be some games where you will have to DOUBLE-Click so the game reads. (I tried to fix it in the code with click delays, times and updates but still buggy)

# Dependencies:
- Install pygame (pip3 install pygame)
- Install requests (pip3 install requests)
- Should also install Certificates.command
And install all the files from the repository
