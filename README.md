# Final_Project---2140-Computing-Fundamentals
This is my final project for 2140 Computing fundamentals class

# My Test README

This is a test repository, used to introduce myself to Git and Github.

## Markdown

This README file supports Markdown syntax and so I can create
section headers using the '#' symbol followed by a title, on its own line.

## Contents

This repository should contain the following folders/files:
- data
- fcopy.py
- test_fcopy.py
The `data` folder contains sample data files that can be read or written by
my application.
The `test_fcopy.py` file contains all the tests.
The `fcopy.py` file contains the main python application.
